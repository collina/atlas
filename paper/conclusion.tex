\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we have presented a model of an interference detection platform that builds on top of the RIPE Atlas community. Previous examinations of Internet filtering have tended to analyze specific national apparatuses on a per-country unit, assuming internal consistency across providers and time. This past approach has been appropriate for describing the diversity of methods used to control access globally, as well as for when the primary research focus is on countries that impose restrictions at central points of international transit. 

As Internet filtering has proliferated to countries with competition and private markets at the international frontier, researchers can no longer assume direct and homogenous control by authorities. The two recent and developing cases of interference in Russia and Turkey demonstrate this shifting environment. Russia and Turkey's networks are more administratively and technically decentralized than China and Iran~\cite{Roberts2011}. Through longitudinal observation, our initial research demonstrates substantive differences of methods ands rates of implementation, and, in at least one case, even selective compliance for content restrictions. In both Turkey and Russia, the Atlas network provided a unique opportunity for documenting rapidly-evolving information controls due to its nearly ubiquitous geographic presence, stability for recurrent measurements, and external queuing of targets. Reliance on alternative models outlined in Section~\ref{related_work} would have imposed delays on deployment of measurements and limited the number of vantage points from which data could be collected. 

These findings contribute to broader discussions on anti-filtering strategies.  Collateral damage, urgency and level of difficulty appears to have shaped the implementation of Turkey and Russia's filtering mandates and responses to circumvention. The quick removal of restrictions on Google Public DNS, and then attempts to impersonate the service, indicate that enforcing an absolute prohibition on content is partially an economic question. Where there are high collateral costs, such as with YouTube in Turkey and LiveJournal in Russia, authorities appear to have limited their restrictions or found cooperative arrangements with platform owners. 

Atlas was well positioned for documentation of both blocking incidents based on telecommunications companies reliance on interfering with network reachability and domain name translation. If administrators had utilized traffic inspection, or more subtly degraded connectivity without outright blocking access, the platform would not have been capable of documenting these events.

Despite these analytical precautions, Atlas-based measurements provide an early perspective on the opportunities and methodologies concomitant with pervasive network observation. We document multifarious filtering infrastructures in both countries, notably reliant on DNS manipulation and redirection of traffic by transit providers. Additionally, the latter manipulation of network routes represents an underexplored method of interference and invokes the need for tools to collect path information to complement other forms of documentation. Furthermore, differences of restrictions shed light on  inconsistencies in the application of administrative orders, and could provide early warning of increased controls in the future. Our initial research demonstrates that across national networks there are substantive differences of methods, rates of implementation, and, in at least one case, even selective compliance for information controls that are measurable by Atlas and future initiatives.
