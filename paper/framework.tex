\section{Framework structure}
\subsection{Ripe Atlas background}
Here we need to describe a qucik desciption of RIPE and example of how to use it using command line. 
Philipp here you can explain the hping look a like package you wrote. 

We also need to mention how you can stablish a big experiments using RIPE. And mention about the propblem of how you frist need to submit your experiments and then it will give you predicted cost. This way we can move to cost function.




RIPE Atlas~\cite{atlas} is an Internet measurement network which was started in 2010 by RIPE NCC.
All measurement probes which constitute the network are run by volunteers.  Once a user connected
her probe to the network, it can be used for measurements and the user is also able to run custom
measurements by spending some of the network's currency, Atlas credits.  These credits are awarded
automatically based on the upme of contributed probes.

% What kind of measurements does Atlas allow?
As of today, Atlas allows four types of measurements; ping, traceroute, DNS resolution, and X.509
certificate fetching.  All four measurement types can further be parameterised for more fine-grained
control.
