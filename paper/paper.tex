% TEMPLATE for Usenix papers, specifically to meet requirements of
%  USENIX '05
% originally a template for producing IEEE-format articles using LaTeX.
%   written by Matthew Ward, CS Department, Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
% adapted by David Beazley for his excellent SWIG paper in Proceedings,
%   Tcl 96
% turned into a smartass generic template by De Clarke, with thanks to
%   both the above pioneers
% use at your own risk.  Complaints to /dev/null.
% make it two column with no page numbering, default is 10 point

% Munged by Fred Douglis <douglis@research.att.com> 10/97 to separate
% the .sty file from the LaTeX source template, so that people can
% more easily include the .sty file into an existing document.  Also
% changed to more closely follow the style guidelines as represented
% by the Word sample file. 

% Note that since 2010, USENIX does not require endnotes. If you want
% foot of page notes, don't include the endnotes package in the 
% usepackage command, below.

% This version uses the latex2e styles, not the very ancient 2.09 stuff.

\subsection*{Abstract}
A quick understanding of the spread of Internet censorship has become important especially now that
many countries are using it to shutdown protests. It appears that controlling Internet traffic and
routing through different censorship techniques are easy to implement by governments and ISPs. While
researchers and activists are having a hard time find a distributed research volunteered clients to
investigate the state of accesicibality of Internet in different regions around the globe especially
for the ones that matter the most. In this paper, we discuss our efforts to find a proper/desired platform
to investigate CASESTUDY and CASESTUDY. We used RIPE ATLAS which is  (talk about benefits) but
(negatives). We propose an algorithm to balance timeliness, diversity , and cost to facilitate the
usage of ripe.
