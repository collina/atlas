% TEMPLATE for Usenix papers, specifically to meet requirements of
%  USENIX '05
% originally a template for producing IEEE-format articles using LaTeX.
%   written by Matthew Ward, CS Department, Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
% adapted by David Beazley for his excellent SWIG paper in Proceedings,
%   Tcl 96
% turned into a smartass generic template by De Clarke, with thanks to
%   both the above pioneers
% use at your own risk.  Complaints to /dev/null.
% make it two column with no page numbering, default is 10 point

% Munged by Fred Douglis <douglis@research.att.com> 10/97 to separate
% the .sty file from the LaTeX source template, so that people can
% more easily include the .sty file into an existing document.  Also
% changed to more closely follow the style guidelines as represented
% by the Word sample file. 

% Note that since 2010, USENIX does not require endnotes. If you want
% foot of page notes, don't include the endnotes package in the 
% usepackage command, below.

% This version uses the latex2e styles, not the very ancient 2.09 stuff.

\subsection*{Abstract}

As Internet filtering practices proliferate internationally, researchers can no longer presume the consistent and homogenous imposition of information controls, evoking the need for pervasive observation longitudinally across national networks. Existing interference measurement platforms frequently suffer from poor adoption, insufficient geographic coverage, and scalability problems. Therefore, in order to outline an analytical framework and data collection needs for future ubiquitous measurements initiatives, we build on top of the existent and widely-deployed RIPE Atlas platform. We propose methods for monitoring the reachability of vital services through an algorithm that balance timeliness, diversity, and cost. We then use Atlas to investigate blocking events in Turkey and Russia. Our measurements uncover previously under-examined forms of interference and evidence of cooperation between a well-known blogging platform and government authorities for purposes of blocking hosted content.
