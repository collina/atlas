The problem: we might endanger probe contributors by running censored queries over their probes.
Contributors probably don't expect that their probe is used for censorship analysis.

Our justification: Plausible deniability, we are limited to X.509/DNS/ping/traceroute.  We are not
claiming that everything is OK.  Instead, we encourage further discussion.
