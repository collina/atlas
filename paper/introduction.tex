\section{Introduction}

An important counter strategy for the proliferation of Internet filtering mandates is to
measure, document, and expose interference in the free flow of information.  Sunlight is said to be a
disinfectant and, by shedding light on these events, the public's attention can
be drawn toward information controls.  Several methods exist to detect and assess
Internet filtering.  Ideally, the analyst has direct control over a censored
source host that can perform measurements against an external destination.
This is typically not the case, however, so research often has to
opportunistically resort to open proxies, the help of volunteers, and existing
measurement platforms.  All of these methods have advantages and disadvantages.
Open proxies suffer from low network coverage, are unreliable or questionably
reflect typical conditions, and are often limited to TCP streams or HTTP
requests.  Cooperation with volunteers exposes individuals to potential harm
and is time-consuming. Current, specially-designed censorship measurement
platforms suffer from limited deployment and insufficient maintenance.
Therefore, in order to develop representative and real-time perspectives of
interference, we build a prospective mechanism on top of an existing,
widely-deployed measurement platform, the RIPE Atlas network~\cite{atlas}.

Measurement and analysis of information controls is a non-zero sum development effort.
Existing platforms, such as PlanetLab~\cite{planetlab}, Herdict~\cite{Herdict},
and OONI~\cite{Filasto2012} are complementary and provide unique perspectives
on the diverse forms of interference.  We believe that an interference analysis
platform based on Atlas can provide an additional perspective to the bigger
picture, one whose strengths are wide deployment, rapid results, and the
foreshadowing of broader community lessons.  Toward these objectives, we make the
following contributions.

\begin{itemize}
	\item We evaluate the aptitude of the RIPE Atlas platform for
		analysis of information controls and propose an algorithm to balance timeliness, network
		diversity, and cost, in order to facilitate effective analysis.
	\item We apply the platform and algorithm for monitoring of ongoing
		filtering events across different countries, and provide results based
		on several months of measurements.
\end{itemize}

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.
Section~\ref{related_work} begins by giving an overview of related work, which
is then followed by our framework's structure in
Section~\ref{sec:framework}. After, we present two case studies in
Section~\ref{sec:case_studies} and conclude the paper with final thoughts
in~Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
