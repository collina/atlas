% Longitudinal studies.
It is not difficult to conduct one-off censorship studies because censors
typically do not have sufficient time to react and thwart the study.
Longitudinal studies, on the other hand, are more challenging as they have to
be designed in a tamper-proof and sustainable way.  In 2007, Crandall et al.
proposed ConceptDoppler~\cite{Crandall2007}.  The design enables longitudinal
censorship analysis by detecting which keywords are filtered by the Great
Firewall of China (GFW) over time.  More recently, CensMon was introduced by
Sfakianakis et al. in 2011~\cite{Sfakianakis2011}.  CensMon is a web censorship
monitor which is run on top of PlanetLab~\cite{planetlab}.  Most recently, in
2012, Filast\`{o} and Appelbaum presented OONI~\cite{Filasto2012}.  In
contrast to CensMon and ConceptDoppler, OONI is deployed and has been used
successfully.\footnote{Gathered reports are available online at:
\url{https://ooni.torproject.org/reports/}.}  In parallel to all open platforms
discussed above, proprietary platforms exist~\cite{hwang2007herdict,opennet}.


% Comparison to other projects.
Table~\ref{tab:comparison} contains a comparison between popular and deployed
platforms which are or can be used for censorship analysis.  Our comparison is
based on \emph{flexibility} (i.e., how many types of measurements can be run?),
\emph{coverage} (i.e., how many probes in how many countries are available?),
and \emph{blocking resistance} (i.e., how easy it is for censors to disable the
respective platform?).  We qualitatively compare all platforms and assign them
the labels ``Low'', ``Medium'', or ``High''.  Note that we do not propose
Atlas as \emph{replacement} for any existing censorship measurement platforms.
Instead, we see it as a \emph{complement} which contributes to the already
existing landscape.

% Previous Atlas censorship analysis.
Atlas has already been used as platform for censorship analysis outside an
academic setting.  In 2014, Maass used Atlas to find inconsistencies in the DNS
records and X.509 certificates for torproject.org~\cite{Maass2014}.  In the
same year, Bortzmeyer and Aben independently discussed Internet censorship in
Turkey~\cite{Bortzmeyer14,Aben14}.  While we discuss the same topic in
Section~\ref{sec:case_studies}, we do so with significantly more data and in a
more rigorous fashion.

% Side channel measurements.
% TODO - Are there more papers we are missing?
In the absence of analysis platforms or other means to access machines inside
censoring countries, censorship analysis has to resort to exploiting TCP/IP
side channels.  In particular, Ensafi et al. demonstrated that it is possible
to measure intentional packet dropping without controlling either the source or
the destination machine~\cite{Ensafi2014}.
