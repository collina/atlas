    * HTTP requests would be interesting for us.  Might be problematic for them
      because of spamming issues.

    * We could use SSL-based measurements targeting email providers to catch
      state-sponsored attacks.

    * Answer to "what if they forge results?": It's way easier for censors to
      simply blacklist probes.  Tampering/whitelisting results is more
      difficult.

    * Cost function is very deterministic.  It depends on test, size of
      packets, etc.

    * We could do DNS queries to non-existing targets because we won't get
      charged for non-existing responses.  We might get some isolated DNS
      injection responses, though.

    * When doing measurements, let's put our parameters on the wiki so Roya can
      figure out the cost function.

    * With Turkey, we now have a good practical example.  Russia would be
      another good one.

    * We want situational awareness to get a good and recent target list.
      Herdict might be low-hanging fruit and they have a JSON API.

    * High-level and important question: "Where exactly is Twitter blocked?".

    * Regarding censorship in Europe: Is there really a lawful list of censored
      web pages?  Wouldn't this be like an index of CP?  How does engelliweb
      get its list?

    * First, we want to get more Atlas probes to accumulate credits.
    * Organisation is interested in real-time assessment of high-profile news
      sites such as the New York Times.
    * Big concern: Censors could whitelist all Atlas probes.  But:
      - Something like that has never happend.  Would be interesting to
        witness.
      - Blocking them comes at a (high?) cost.
      - Many probes might have dynamic IP addresses which would increase cost.
      - We should acknowledge possibility, though.
    * We want to acquire a list of targets to probe: (Collin)
      - DNS (high-profile web sites, file sharing, adult content, ...).  Look
        at Herdict, citizen lab paper and maybe Google trends, news sites,
        Twitter, ...
      - Ping, traceroute: Tor directory authorities and relays.
      - X.509: EMail providers.
    * In general, we want to balance three things:
      - Timeliness.
      - Number and diversity of targets.
      - Countries/ASes (maybe look at Google trends and Herdict etc to get
                        countries of current interest)
    * We need a smart sampling algorithm.  Majority of probes are in US and DE
      and we don't care that much about them. (Roya)
    * We might get some additional credit directly from RIPE.
    * We should get a better idea of how RIPE's API works to start writing some
      code.  Also, JSON parsers would be good to have. (Philipp)
    * We should be very clear on how our stuff is different from Herdict,
      M-Lab, OONI, PlanetLab etc. (Collin)
    * Notes should go on the wiki.

2014-03-07:
    * We should try to get more probes in order to accumulate credits faster.
    * A list of interesting targets (i.e., blocked web sites) would be helpful:
        - new york times
        - torrent sites such as thepiratebay.se
        - adult content
    * Come up with a smart algorithm for continuous scans of interesting
      targets.  Depending on the threat, target, etc., the algorithm's
      parameters would differ.
